# ArmillaEACS

Group project for undergraduate thesis on system dev., **Armilla EACS**(Entry Acess Control System) is looking forward to help on secure access control in private events, membership access and much more! This project relies on the RFID technology (13.56mhz) to identify and allow people, using the PHP [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/) for back-end.

In order to run this application locally, you'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), as well as [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/windows/wsl/install)(if you are a Windows 10 or 11 user) for easier terminal integration.
